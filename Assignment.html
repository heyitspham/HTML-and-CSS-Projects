			<p>According to DogTime:</p>
			<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
			"Originally bred to hunt, haul sledges, and herd reindeer, the Samoyed dog breed proved a valuable companion for northwestern Siberia’s Samoyede people. Among the breed’s duties: pack hiking, tracking, and warming their owners by sleeping on top of them at night.
			
			As a working breed, Samoyeds can be strong-willed at times, but above all they remain friendly, gentle, and devoted family dogs. They’re affectionate with almost everyone, so long as new people don’t mind some shedding and stray hairs on their clothes."
